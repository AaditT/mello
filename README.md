# mello

To build, type "make" and press Enter.
Then, type "./mello <number of notes> <key signature>".

To denote a major key, just type in the letter; "A" means A major, for example.
Add a lowercase m, like "Am" for A minor, for a minor key.
For flatted keys, add a "b". For example, "Abm" is A flat minor.
Sharp keys use \# signs. "C\#" is C sharp major.
